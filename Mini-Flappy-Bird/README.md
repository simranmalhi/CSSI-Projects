# Mini-Flappy-Bird

Hello! This is a version of Flappy Bird that I created with @christinawong and @kristynhan.

This web page was created using Glitch and exported to github.

You click to start the game and move the bird (the yellow circle) using the up arrow key.

Just like flappy bird, if the bird touches a pipe or the ground it's game over!

Refresh the page to play again.

Have fun :)
